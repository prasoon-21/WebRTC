# Asesino Meet 🔐  
**Privacy-First One-on-One Video Calling**

Asesino Meet is a **secure, peer-to-peer one-on-one video calling web application** built with a single goal:

> **No servers. No logs. No storage. No one in the middle.**

Unlike traditional platforms such as **Google Meet** and **Zoom**, Asesino Meet does **not route your audio or video through centralized media servers**. Communication happens **directly between two peers**, ensuring maximum privacy and control.

This repository contains the **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** of the first product by **Binary Asesino**.  
The full version is launching soon.

## 🚫 Why Not Google Meet or Zoom?

Most popular video conferencing tools:
- Use centralized infrastructure
- Route calls through servers
- Can store metadata, logs, or recordings
- Are optimized for group meetings, not privacy

**Asesino Meet is different by design.**
